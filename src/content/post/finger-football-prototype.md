We wanted to explore a new take on football games, something intuitive and fun. So, we built a prototype using Godot, focusing on touch-based gameplay.

## The Concept: Finger Football

Imagine controlling a football game with just your fingers. We used two fingers as the player's two legs, creating a unique and engaging experience.

## Gameplay: Touch and Curve

* **POV Touch:** The game is played from a first-person perspective, with touch controls.
* **Finger Legs:** Two fingers act as the player's legs, allowing for intuitive kicking motions.
* **Curved Shots:** The ball's trajectory curves based on the direction and speed of your finger drag, mimicking real football kicks.

## Tech Behind the Game: Godot Engine

We used Godot Engine for this prototype, leveraging its flexibility and ease of use to quickly bring our concept to life.

## Why This Prototype?

* **Intuitive Controls:** We wanted to create a game that felt natural and responsive.
* **Unique Gameplay:** The finger-based controls offer a fresh take on football simulations.
* **Exploration of Touch Mechanics:** We wanted to explore the possibilities of touch-based gameplay in a sports context.

## What's Next?

This prototype is a starting point. We're excited to explore further development and refine the gameplay mechanics.

**Conclusion:**

Our finger football prototype demonstrates our commitment to exploring innovative game concepts and pushing the boundaries of touch-based gameplay.
