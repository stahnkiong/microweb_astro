> **2020.** The world was in chaos. COVID-19 was shutting down borders, and Sarawak, like everyone else, needed a way to protect its people. We were faced with a daunting task: how to manage the influx of travelers while keeping everyone safe.

## Our Solution: A Sarawakian Innovation Born of Necessity

We didn't have months. We had days. We needed a solution, and we needed it fast. So, we built a wearable tech system using QR codes. Think of it as a digital shield, designed and built right here in Sarawak.

### 1. Tracking Traveler Movement: Digital Footprints, Real-Time Data

We created wristbands with unique QR codes. By scanning these codes at checkpoints, authorities could track traveler movement within Sarawak. No more guesswork; we had real-time data.

### 2. Ensuring Compliance: Keeping Everyone Accountable

Random QR code scans ensured people were following quarantine and health protocols. It was about keeping everyone safe, and everyone accountable.

### 3. Facilitating Contact Tracing: Speed and Efficiency

In the event of a positive COVID-19 case, contact tracing became lightning fast. We could quickly identify who had been in close proximity, minimizing the spread.

### Privacy First: Protecting Personal Data

We knew privacy was critical. So, we built in safeguards:

* **Data Minimization:** We only collected essential info.
* **Secure Storage:** Data was encrypted and locked down.
* **Limited Access:** Only authorized personnel could access it.
* **Regular Audits:** We made sure everything was compliant.

### 72 Hours: A Herculean Effort

We had three days. Three. Days. To conceptualize, develop, test, and deploy the entire system. It was a sprint, a marathon, and everything in between. We worked around the clock, fueled by coffee and a sense of urgency.

### The Results: A Testament to Sarawakian Ingenuity

This wasn't just a tech project; it was a lifeline. We showed the world what Sarawak's tech community could do. We built a robust and reliable system, in record time, to protect our people.

**Conclusion:**

When the world needed solutions, Sarawak delivered. We proved that innovation can happen anywhere, even in the most challenging times. We built a system that protected lives, and that's something we're incredibly proud of.
