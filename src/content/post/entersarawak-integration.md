We were tasked with a critical integration project for enterSarawak, aimed at streamlining digital border control.

## Objective: Seamless Integration with enterSarawak

Our objective was to integrate our client's system with enterSarawak, automating key processes.

## Deliverables: API Integrations

We delivered the following API integrations:

* **e-HDF Creation:** An API to automatically create "e-HDF" (electronic Health Declaration Form) entries with user profiles and relevant data upon application approval in enterSarawak.
* **enterSarawak Status Updates:** An API call to update the "enterSarawak Status" if there are changes in the "e-HDF Status."
* **e-HDF Status Updates:** An API to update the "e-HDF Status" if there are changes in the "enterSarawak Status."
* **API Activation/Deactivation:** The ability to activate and deactivate the above API processes as needed.
* **Release Notice Process:** Implementation of a release notice process for digital tracking.

## Benefits:

* **Automation:** Automated e-HDF creation and status updates reduced manual work and errors.
* **Real-Time Updates:** API integrations ensured real-time synchronization of data between systems.
* **Flexibility:** The ability to activate and deactivate APIs provided flexibility in managing the integration.
* **Efficient Tracking:** The release notice process enhanced digital tracking capabilities.

## Tech Behind the Scenes:

We used secure and efficient API development practices to ensure reliable integration and data transfer.

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates our ability to deliver robust API integrations, streamlining digital processes and enhancing efficiency for critical systems like enterSarawak.
