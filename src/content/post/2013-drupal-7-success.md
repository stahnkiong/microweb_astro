In 2013, we were given a fantastic opportunity: our first holdings client. We were grateful for their trust, and we knew we had to deliver.

## The Result: Long-Term Reliability

**edit 2025 -** Fast forward 12 years, and the website is still well-maintained and running smoothly. This speaks to the quality of the initial build and the robustness of Drupal 7.
