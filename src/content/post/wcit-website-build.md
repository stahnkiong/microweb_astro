Just back from WCIT 2023 and IDECS 2023 in Sarawak! Amazing experience, and we built a website there, on the fly!

## The Challenge: Website Needed, Yesterday!

Clients at WCIT needed a website, fast. A big event was coming, and they needed a digital presence.

## Our Solution: Rapid Prototyping

We jumped in, creating a prototype with clean design and intuitive UX. Fast.

## Responsive Design: For Every Device

Website had to look good on phones, tablets, laptops, everything. No exceptions.

## Functionality: More Than Just Looks

Website had to do things. Event registration, reminders, workshop bookings, sponsorship info. One-stop shop!
