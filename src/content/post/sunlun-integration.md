Sunlun Group, with customers and subsidiaries across Malaysia and suppliers worldwide, faced a challenge: streamlining their warranty service. Redundant work and manual processes were slowing them down.

## Our Solution: Seamless Integration

We built a web app warranty service that connected customers, suppliers, and their enterprise resource system (Microsoft Dynamics 365).

## How It Works:

* **Online Warranty Requests:** Customers could easily request warranties online.
* **Direct Supplier Integration:** Data was sent directly to suppliers' backends, reducing manual work.
* **API Support:** Suppliers with API integration received data seamlessly.
* **Document Generation:** For suppliers without APIs, we provided an alternative solution to generate required documents.
* **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Integration:** We integrated with their enterprise resource system, ensuring data consistency.

## The Benefits:

* **Reduced Redundancy:** Automated processes eliminated manual data entry.
* **Streamlined Processes:** Customers and suppliers benefited from a more efficient workflow.
* **Improved Customer Experience:** Online warranty requests made the process easier for customers.
* **Global Connectivity:** Seamless integration with suppliers worldwide.

## Tech Behind the Scenes:

We used a combination of web development technologies and API integrations to build a robust and scalable solution.

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates our ability to integrate complex systems, improving efficiency and streamlining processes for global enterprises.
