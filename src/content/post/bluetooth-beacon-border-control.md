During the pandemic, QR codes were our go-to for border control. They worked, but they weren't perfect. We knew we needed something more reliable, something that didn't rely on everyone playing by the rules.

## Recognizing the Limits: Beyond the Scan

QR codes had their issues:

* **Human Error:** People had to scan, and not everyone did.
* **Limited Data:** A scan was just a snapshot, not real-time tracking.
* **GPS Costs:** Tracking everyone with GPS? Too expensive, too impractical.

## Our Solution: Bluetooth Beacons - Real-Time Tracking

We shifted to Bluetooth beacons. Here's why:

* **Real-Time Tracking:** Beacons constantly send signals, tracking movement.
* **Automated Data:** No more manual scans.
* **Enhanced Accuracy:** Multiple beacons pinpoint location precisely.
* **Cost-Effective:** Affordable and power-efficient.

## How It Works: Simple and Effective

* **Wearable Tech:** Beacons in wristbands.
* **Gateway Network:** Beacons placed at key locations.
* **Real-Time Data:** Wristbands talk to gateways.
* **Centralized Analysis:** Data sent to a server.

## Privacy First: Secure and Anonymous

We take privacy seriously. Only essential data is collected, anonymized, and securely stored.

**Conclusion:**

We've moved beyond QR codes, embracing Bluetooth beacons for more reliable, efficient, and privacy-focused border control. As challenges evolve, so do our solutions.
